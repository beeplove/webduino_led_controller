To change the IP and MAC address of Eithernet Shild edit follwoing lines in Webduino_LED_Controller.ino 
static uint8_t mac[] = { 0x90, 0xA2, 0xDA, 0x0D, 0x18, 0x48 };
static uint8_t ip[]  = { 10, 0, 1, 12 };


To change the port where webserver would listen to edit the following in Webduino_LED_Controller.ino
WebServer webserver(PREFIX, 9889);
